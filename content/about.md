Hi, I’m **Brice** — an engineer and researcher working at the intersection of **AI**, **Mathematics**, **Quantitative modeling**, and **Rust systems programming**.

---

### 🧠 What I Work On
- **AI / Machine Learning** – model evaluation, efficient inference, and learning theory  
- **Rust & Systems** – concurrency, async runtimes, compilers/interpreters, performance  
- **Quant & Math** – probability, stochastic processes, optimization  
- **C/C++ Fundamentals** – systems-level engineering and computer architecture

---

### 🧩 What I Believe
> “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — *Leonardo da Vinci*

I believe in building systems that combine rigor, efficiency, and clarity — blending mathematical reasoning with modern software craftsmanship.
