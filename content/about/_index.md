Hi, I’m **Brice** — an engineer and researcher working at the intersection of
**Artificial Intelligence**, **Mathematics**, **Generative Modeling**, and **systems-level engineering**.

My primary interest lies in **generative and multimodal AI systems** — focusing on how representations, optimization, and system constraints interact in large-scale models.
I am particularly drawn to **model architectures, training dynamics, inference efficiency, and cross-modal alignment**, rather than surface-level application development.

Starting **February 2026**, I will pursue a **Master of Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Auckland**, New Zealand, with the long-term goal of advancing toward a **research-oriented (RA / PhD) track** in **generative AI systems and multimodal modeling**.

## 🎓 Education

**B.Eng. in Electronic Information Engineering**
*Harbin University of Science and Technology · Aug 2021 – Jul 2025*

My undergraduate training emphasized a **systems–mathematics dual foundation**, including:

* Computer systems and embedded architectures
* Mathematical modeling and numerical optimization
* High-performance and parallel computing
* Compiler theory and low-level program optimization

**GPA:** 83 / 100

**Master of Artificial Intelligence (180 points)**
*University of Auckland · Feb 2026 – Dec 2027 (expected)*

Planned research focus:

> **Generative AI × Multimodal Modeling × System Optimization**

I am particularly interested in:

* Generative model architectures (Transformer-based, diffusion-style, and hybrid models)
* Multimodal representation learning and alignment
* Training and inference efficiency under system constraints
* Mathematical perspectives on optimization, stability, and generalization

with the intention of continuing toward **research assistantship and doctoral-level study**.

## 💼 Industry Experience

**System Technology Intern — Tencent Cloud**
*CSIG Division · Xingxinghai Lab · Jul 2024 – Sep 2024*

Worked on production-grade cloud infrastructure with an emphasis on **automation, reliability, and performance-aware systems design**.

Key contributions:

* Automated **cloud server deployment pipelines** for stable production environments
* Improved internal **system workflows** to enhance efficiency and reliability
* Collected and analyzed **operational metrics** to support data-driven optimization
* Authored **technical analysis reports** emphasizing correctness and traceability
* Participated in discussions around **distributed system reliability** and **kernel-adjacent performance tuning**

This experience reinforced my interest in **large-scale AI systems**, where **model design and system constraints must be considered jointly**.
