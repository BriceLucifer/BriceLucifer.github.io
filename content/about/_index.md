Hi, I’m **Brice** — an engineer and aspiring researcher working at the intersection of  
**Artificial Intelligence**, **Mathematics**, and **systems-level engineering**.

My core interest lies in **generative and multimodal AI systems**, with a particular focus on how  
**representation learning, optimization dynamics, and system constraints** interact in large-scale models.

Rather than surface-level application development, I am drawn to **foundational and system-aware questions**, such as:

- How architectural choices influence representation and generalization
- How optimization dynamics affect stability and efficiency
- How system constraints (memory, parallelism, latency) shape model design and inference

Starting **February 2026**, I will pursue a **Master of Artificial Intelligence** at the  
**University of Auckland (New Zealand)**, with the long-term goal of advancing toward a  
**research-oriented path (Research Assistantship / PhD)** in **generative and multimodal AI systems**.

## 🎓 Education

**B.Eng. in Electronic Information Engineering**  
*Harbin University of Science and Technology · Aug 2021 – Jul 2025*

My undergraduate training emphasized a **dual foundation in systems and mathematics**, including:

- Computer systems and embedded architectures
- Mathematical modeling and numerical optimization
- High-performance and parallel computing
- Compiler theory and low-level program optimization

**GPA:** 83 / 100

**Master of Artificial Intelligence (180 points)**  
*University of Auckland · Feb 2026 – Dec 2027 (expected)*

Planned research focus:

> **Generative AI × Multimodal Modeling × System Optimization**

I am particularly interested in:

- Transformer-based, diffusion-style, and hybrid generative architectures
- Multimodal representation learning and cross-modal alignment
- Training and inference efficiency under system constraints
- Mathematical perspectives on optimization, stability, and generalization

with the intention of continuing toward **research assistantship and doctoral-level study**.

## 💼 Industry Experience

**System Technology Intern — Tencent Cloud**  
*CSIG Division · Xingxinghai Lab · Jul 2024 – Sep 2024*

Worked on production-grade cloud infrastructure with an emphasis on  
**automation, reliability, and performance-aware system design**.

Key contributions included:

- Automating **cloud server deployment pipelines** for stable production environments
- Improving internal **system workflows** to enhance efficiency and reliability
- Collecting and analyzing **operational metrics** to support data-driven optimization
- Authoring **technical analysis reports** emphasizing correctness and traceability
- Participating in discussions around **distributed system reliability** and  
  **kernel-adjacent performance tuning**

This experience reinforced my interest in **large-scale AI systems**, where  
**model design and system constraints must be considered jointly**.
