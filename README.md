# BriceLucifer.github.io

Personal website and technical notebook of **Brice**.

This site is used to document my work and thinking across:

* Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
* Algorithms and mathematical reasoning
* Systems programming (Rust / C / C++)
* Quantitative modeling and optimization
* Experimental projects and research notes

The content emphasizes **understanding from first principles**, combining theory, implementation, and system-level considerations.

## Website

🔗 **Live site**: [https://bricelucifer.github.io/](https://bricelucifer.github.io/)

## Structure

The site is organized into several sections:

* **Notes**
  Informal research notes, derivations, experiments, and learning logs.
  These pages prioritize clarity of thought over presentation.

* **Blog**
  More polished articles distilled from notes, focusing on reusable ideas,
  key insights, and structured explanations.

* **Projects**
  Selected engineering and research-oriented projects, including
  foundational AI systems and experimental implementations.

## Tech Stack

* **Static site generator**: Hugo
* **Theme**: PaperMod
* **Content**: Markdown / KaTeX / custom shortcodes
* **Hosting**: GitHub Pages

---

## Philosophy

This website is not intended to be a traditional blog.
Instead, it serves as a long-term **thinking archive and technical notebook**,
tracking how ideas evolve over time through study, experimentation, and implementation.
