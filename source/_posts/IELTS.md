> My first phone is from a Korean brand called Samsung, which model is galaxy tabs.   
   my phone is quite big , it's about 11 inch big, which is a big phone back in that time, it also comes with a hand-writing pencil for this phone, which is called s-pen i think, 
   my friends often says it is not a phone, it is a tablet. at some level I could not agree more.

Not only you can take notes as much as you want, but also you can take it everywhere you want because you store it in a small memory. it surely a nice tool i use everyday, i enjoy using it.
